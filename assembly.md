# Case
## Printing
Print both [top case](case/case-top.3mf) and [bottom case](case/case-bottom.3mf).
For the bottom case make sure to seperate the foot from the case.

## Assembly
- Glue the foot onto the back case
- Slide the pcb into the back case
- Press the top case onto the back case, they should snap fit together
