## 10/9/2025 - Designed Idea and Schematic  

In the last around 7 hours I came up with the general idea from hackpad to just a screen to now a combination of both. These changes came with a lot of hardware changes (I think I changed my MCU 3 times).

**Current Idea**
Another Desk thing/peripheral, it features should be:

- clock
- act as a small desk light
- multiple pages of macros
- display notifications and make sure to get the attention of the user (blink and buzz)

**What I now decided on:**

- 2.8" screen
- 2 keyboard switches
- a rotary encoder
- a passiv buzzer
- a 3V rigid LED filament
- esp32 s3

**What took you so long?**
This is my first bigger pcb design project, so I had to learn the hardware that it is not just connecting gpio to the next pin, e.g. I originally thought I could just hook the LED to my esp32, but in reality the current needed surpasses the range of esp so I had to learn about transistors and LDO's. Now I have a seperate LDO connected to the positive side of the LED and a transistor between gpio and GND to control the LED. Another thing that took a long time is choosing a fitting screen which has acceptable documentation to create a footprint...
