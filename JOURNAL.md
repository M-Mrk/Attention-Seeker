## 10/9/2025 - Designed Idea and Schematic  

In the last around 7 hours I came up with the general idea from hackpad to just a screen to now a combination of both. These changes came with a lot of hardware changes (I think I changed my MCU 3 times).

**Current Idea**
Another Desk thing/peripheral, it features should be:

- clock
- act as a small desk light
- multiple pages of macros
- display notifications and make sure to get the attention of the user (blink and buzz)

**What I now decided on:**

- 2.8" screen
- 2 keyboard switches
- a rotary encoder
- a passiv buzzer
- a 3V rigid LED filament
- esp32 s3

**What took you so long?**
This is my first bigger pcb design project, so I had to learn the hardware that it is not just connecting gpio to the next pin, e.g. I originally thought I could just hook the LED to my esp32, but in reality the current needed surpasses the range of esp so I had to learn about transistors and LDO's. Now I have a seperate LDO connected to the positive side of the LED and a transistor between gpio and GND to control the LED. Another thing that took a long time is choosing a fitting screen which has acceptable documentation to create a footprint...

**Current Schematic**

## 10/13/2025 4 PM - Routed the PCB  

Since the last entry I changed some things. I added a third Keyboard switch, to have even more quick options. I actually did the pcb and routed it and only changed the layout 3 times...

Next up I need to figure the BOM out and source my parts. I could also start with the software, which will need to be run on the pc to gather the notification data...
  

## 10/13/2025 10 PM - Finished up the pcb  

I rearranged my repo to have more clear division between software and hardware.

I created a real README

I also rendered some pictures of the pcb:

Added silkscreen descriptions and art (boo!)

And what took the most time, I did the BOM. I hate aliexpress now, why is it so hard to get just the URL and why can you not share the selected option... Well I think I am now ready to certify for the grant to get to building and coding!   

## 10/14/2025 - Finished up the pcb (x2)  

I realized my footprint for the MCU didnt account for the usb headers like I thought it did... So I had to move it alot further to the edge.

Because of this move I ofcourse had to reroute the pcb, but this time I now have one Ground loop which can not hurt. I also added a wrong 3d model for the MCU, as I cant find a fitting one but this is close enough for the modelling of the case and exchanged the BOM entry for it for a cheaper one.

My first approach for mounting the screen was to solder female headers to the board, but now I think that that would make the screen stick out too much compared to the keys. So I made the holes in the pads larger to directly fit the screen, but now I might need to trim the pins of the MCU and desolder or isolate the sd card slot of the screen.

The next step will be modelling the case
